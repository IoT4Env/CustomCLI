# CustomCLI

Personally i'm a fan on CLI, so i decided to develop one of them from SCRATCH.
By that i mean no external libraries or tools, just pure C# code that i know what it does and how to write it.

## How does it work

This CLI simulates the cmd from Windows and Linux the one that let the user navigate in the file system (fs).
So it can create files, folders, print stuff on the terminal, etc...
Commands used in this project are a mix of both Windows and Linux, although some command names are different.
